## Unprotected Functionality:
a website might host sensitive functionality at the following URL:
https://insecure-website.com/admin
This might be accessible by any user, not only administrative users who have a link to the functionality in their user interface. In some cases, the administrative URL might be disclosed in other locations, such as the robots.txt file:
https://insecure-website.com/robots.txt

## Parameter-based access control methods: 
Some applications determine the user's access rights or role at login, and then store this information in a user-controllable location. This could be:
	A hidden field.
	A cookie. Could be found by going pressing F12 in browser>Application> under Admin/Root> edit> value from false to true and refresh site.
  A preset query string parameter.

## Horizontal privilege escalation:
Horizontal privilege escalation attacks may use similar types of exploit methods to vertical privilege escalation. For example, a user might access their own account page using the following URL:
https://insecure-website.com/myaccount?id=123
If an attacker modifies the id parameter value to that of another user, they might gain access to another user's account page, and the associated data and functions.
Login with credinitals you have already and then change id with other users id number or name can cause the escalation.

## Burp Suite: Username Enumeration:
1.	With Burp running, investigate the login page and submit an invalid username and password.
2.	In Burp, go to Proxy > HTTP history and find the POST /login request. Highlight the value of the username parameter in the request and send it to Burp Intruder.
Ex. username=Zfczvzx&password=zvczsvzsv
Add: username=§Zfczvzx§&password=§zvczsvzsv§
3.	In Burp Intruder, go to the Positions tab. Notice that the username parameter is automatically set as a payload position. This position is indicated by two § symbols, for example: username=§invalid-username§. Leave the password as any static value for now.
4.	Make sure that the Sniper attack type is selected.
5.	On the Payloads tab, make sure that the Simple list payload type is selected.
6.	Under Payload settings, paste the list of candidate usernames. Finally, click Start attack. The attack will start in a new window.
7.	When the attack is finished, on the Results tab, examine the Length column. You can click on the column header to sort the results. Notice that one of the entries is longer than the others. Compare the response to this payload with the other responses. Notice that other responses contain the message Invalid username, but this response says Incorrect password. Make a note of the username in the Payload column.
8.	Close the attack and go back to the Positions tab. Click Clear, then change the username parameter to the username you just identified. Add a payload position to the password parameter. The result should look something like this:
username=identified-user&password=§invalid-password§
9.	On the Payloads tab, clear the list of usernames and replace it with the list of candidate passwords. Click Start attack.
10.	When the attack is finished, look at the Status column. Notice that each request received a response with a 200 status code except for one, which got a 302 response. This suggests that the login attempt was successful - make a note of the password in the Payload column.
11.	Log in using the username and password that you identified and access the user account page to solve the lab

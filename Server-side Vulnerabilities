## Unprotected Functionality:
a website might host sensitive functionality at the following URL:
https://insecure-website.com/admin
This might be accessible by any user, not only administrative users who have a link to the functionality in their user interface. In some cases, the administrative URL might be disclosed in other locations, such as the robots.txt file:
https://insecure-website.com/robots.txt

## Parameter-based access control methods: 
Some applications determine the user's access rights or role at login, and then store this information in a user-controllable location. This could be:
	A hidden field.
	A cookie. Could be found by going pressing F12 in browser>Application> under Admin/Root> edit> value from false to true and refresh site.
  A preset query string parameter.

  https://insecure-website.com/login/home.jsp?role=1

## Horizontal privilege escalation:
Horizontal privilege escalation attacks may use similar types of exploit methods to vertical privilege escalation. For example, a user might access their own account page using the following URL:
https://insecure-website.com/myaccount?id=123
If an attacker modifies the id parameter value to that of another user, they might gain access to another user's account page, and the associated data and functions.
Login with credinitals you have already and then change id with other users id number or name can cause the escalation.

## Burp Suite: Username Enumeration:
1.	With Burp running, investigate the login page and submit an invalid username and password.
2.	In Burp, go to Proxy > HTTP history and find the POST /login request. Highlight the value of the username parameter in the request and send it to Burp Intruder.
Ex. username=Zfczvzx&password=zvczsvzsv
Add: username=§Zfczvzx§&password=§zvczsvzsv§
3.	In Burp Intruder, go to the Positions tab. Notice that the username parameter is automatically set as a payload position. This position is indicated by two § symbols, for example: username=§invalid-username§. Leave the password as any static value for now.
4.	Make sure that the Sniper attack type is selected.
5.	On the Payloads tab, make sure that the Simple list payload type is selected.
6.	Under Payload settings, paste the list of candidate usernames. Finally, click Start attack. The attack will start in a new window.
7.	When the attack is finished, on the Results tab, examine the Length column. You can click on the column header to sort the results. Notice that one of the entries is longer than the others. Compare the response to this payload with the other responses. Notice that other responses contain the message Invalid username, but this response says Incorrect password. Make a note of the username in the Payload column.
8.	Close the attack and go back to the Positions tab. Click Clear, then change the username parameter to the username you just identified. Add a payload position to the password parameter. The result should look something like this:
username=identified-user&password=§invalid-password§
9.	On the Payloads tab, clear the list of usernames and replace it with the list of candidate passwords. Click Start attack.
10.	When the attack is finished, look at the Status column. Notice that each request received a response with a 200 status code except for one, which got a 302 response. This suggests that the login attempt was successful - make a note of the password in the Payload column.
11.	Log in using the username and password that you identified and access the user account page to solve the lab

## Burp Suite: 2FA simple bypass:
Log in to your own account. Your 2FA verification code will be sent to you by email. Click the Email client button to access your emails.
Go to your account page and make a note of the URL.
Log out of your account.
Log in using the victim's credentials.
When prompted for the verification code, manually change the URL to navigate to /my-account. The lab is solved when the page loads.

## Burp Suite: SSRF(Server Side Request Forgery) against another back-end system

Visit a product, click "Check stock", intercept the request in Burp Suite, and send it to Burp Intruder.
Click "Clear §", change the stockApi parameter to http://192.168.0.1:8080/admin then highlight the final octet of the IP address (the number 1), click "Add §".
Switch to the Payloads tab, change the payload type to Numbers, and enter 1, 255, and 1 in the "From" and "To" and "Step" boxes respectively.
Click "Start attack".
Click on the "Status" column to sort it by status code ascending. You should see a single entry with a status of 200, showing an admin interface.
Click on this request, send it to Burp Repeater, and change the path in the stockApi to: /admin/delete?username=carlos


## Burp Suite: Remote code execution via web shell upload

While proxying traffic through Burp, log in to your account and notice the option for uploading an avatar image.
Upload an arbitrary image, then return to your account page. Notice that a preview of your avatar is now displayed on the page.
In Burp, go to Proxy > HTTP history. Click the filter bar to open the Filter settings dialog. Under Filter by MIME type, enable the Images checkbox, then apply your changes.
In the proxy history, notice that your image was fetched using a GET request to /files/avatars/<YOUR-IMAGE>. Send this request to Burp Repeater.

On your system, create a file called exploit.php, containing a script for fetching the contents of Carlos's secret file. For example:
<?php echo file_get_contents('/home/carlos/secret'); ?>
Use the avatar upload function to upload your malicious PHP file. The message in the response confirms that this was uploaded successfully.

In Burp Repeater, change the path of the request to point to your PHP file:
GET /files/avatars/exploit.php HTTP/1.1
Send the request. Notice that the server has executed your script and returned its output (Carlos's secret) in the response.
Submit the secret to solve the lab.
